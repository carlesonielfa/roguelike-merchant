# Roguelike merchant game
Name: Luck of the Isles

## Overview
### Project scope
Single player procedurally generated game that mixes casino and roguelike mechanics and features simple click/tap controls.

### Elevator pitch
Play as a merchant deep in debt. 

Pay your debt installments by trading with the different cities in the procedurally generated map. 

In this world you can only get goods by gambling, hit the slot machine in a city to try and get some goods to sell to other cities before the time to pay is up. 

Every time you pay an installment to your creditor you get an item that will help you in your journey.

If you canâ€™t pay the game is over. 

Your objective is to last for the longest time possible.

### Target platforms
The game suits mobile platforms since it doesnâ€™t require complex 3D graphics and the controls can be implemented with only tap/click.

Releasing on desktop (PC) is also viable because the game has enough complexity on its mechanics to make it interesting for experienced pc gamers.

The game shouldnâ€™t target a console release since point and click controls donâ€™t mix very well with controllers, and this genre of game isnâ€™t very popular on consoles.

### Monetization

The ideal monetization model would be an upfront payment. PC gamers are used to paying for games but for mobile users it could be a hard sell since most games on mobile are free to play, for this reason releasing a free to play limited version and a priced full version should be considered.
